# Python project Bioinformatics introduction

To meet the needs of the biologist, we have created a program based on	
the binding properties of a microRNA:
- The microRNA binds in the 3'UTR region of the target transcript	
- The microRNA recognizes a sequence on the target transcript that is complementary to the	
of the region called seed from the 2nd to the 7th nucleotide of the microRNA
For this purpose, we have several tools to build a robust program such as	
Genbank cards, transcript sequences and microRNA sequences in Fasta format.	
sequences in Fasta format.
To be able to open and read the file, we have created the function "readFasta", which will read it	
and return separately the header, corresponding to the first line, and the sequence, from the second	
from the second line.	We also have another function "write_on_file" to save our results under the	
our results under the desired extension
