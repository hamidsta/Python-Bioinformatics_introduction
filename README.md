# Python project Bioinformatics introduction

To meet the needs of the biologist, i have created a program based on	
the binding properties of a microRNA:

- The microRNA binds in the 3'UTR region of the target transcript	
- The microRNA recognizes a sequence on the target transcript that is complementary to the	
of the region called seed from the 2nd to the 7th nucleotide of the microRNA
For this purpose, i used several tools to build a robust program such as	
Genbank cards, transcript sequences and microRNA sequences in Fasta format.
